# Shiny WebApp With Form & Leaflet Map

-   The project now has a domain name too:
    [sustainableeateries.com/](http://sustainableeateries.com/)!

This repo contains the code to make a webapp using R Shiny with the
following features:  
1. Form that feeds data to google sheets  
2. Use of Google Maps APIs in the form fields (autocomplete, geocoding)  
3. Leaflet to plot data from sheets: + Clusters for larger data + Searching through
data + Marker colors by variables  
4. Recaptcha for security

Stepwise building of the webapp has been explained in this [blog
post](https://nirzaree.wordpress.com/2020/10/11/building-a-webapp-for-data-collection-visualization-using-r-shiny/).

Steps to get the code running:  
1. If you require any google maps api keys, then make a google maps
account and generate the keys and enter them in the required locations
in the code.  
2. If you use googlesheets for data entry, then make a .secret folder
in the same directory as the app file and then force authentication once
for the project to make sure the token is cached there.  
3. If you require recaptcha, then generate your keys (site key and
secret key) from <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/> 
4. Generate a google sheet to store the data. (Sample [data
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zo3MSY_W_sNlT4AN8RTOAamG79gnCt70c1uDRrOgUag/edit?usp=sharing))   
5. Run the app.    
6. View if the data is being filled correctly.

are eateries around you, check the webapp live at

I am also looking for collaborators for this project to work on some
more features so do reach out.

Adios! âœ¨
